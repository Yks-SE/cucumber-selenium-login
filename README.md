# Automated Login Testing with Cucumber and Selenium

This project implements automated tests for the login page at https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login using **Cucumber (BDD)**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, and **JUnit 5** with the Cucumber JUnit Platform Engine. It includes:
- Gherkin feature files for Valid Login, Invalid Login, and Empty Fields.
- Java step definitions with proper assertions.
- Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.
- Data-driven tests using both `Scenario Outline` **Examples** and a **CSV** file (bonus).
- Headless Chrome defaults for CI (GitHub Actions ready).
- HTML and JSON reports.

## Prerequisites
- Java 11+
- Maven 3.8+
- Internet access (for WebDriverManager to provision ChromeDriver automatically).

## How to Run Locally
```bash
mvn clean test
mvn verify   # generates detailed HTML report at target/cucumber-html-reports
```
To see the pretty HTML report: open `target/cucumber-report.html` (generated by Cucumber plugin) and the aggregated report under `target/cucumber-html-reports`.

## GitHub Actions
A ready-to-use workflow is provided in `.github/workflows/maven.yml` which runs the suite on Ubuntu with headless Chrome and uploads the HTML reports as artifacts.

## Notes on the "Empty Fields" Scenario
The target site does **not** mark the username/password fields as `required`. Browsers therefore do not display the built-in "This field is required" message. When you submit empty fields, the application responds with the banner: **"Your username is invalid!"**.  
Our implementation validates **either** the native HTML5 validation message (if `required` appears in the future) **or** the app's banner message to ensure reliability across environments.

## Data-Driven Bonus
- `Scenario Outline` with Examples is provided in the feature file.
- Additional rows are read from `src/test/resources/data/login.csv` to run multiple credential permutations programmatically.

## Useful Maven Profiles (optional)
You can run only tagged scenarios, e.g.:
```bash
mvn -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke" test
```


## Allure Reports
Generate Allure HTML after tests:
```bash
mvn allure:report
# open target/site/allure-maven-plugin/index.html
```
Artifacts are also uploaded in CI.


## One-click run
- **Windows:** double-click `run.bat`
- **macOS/Linux:** run `./run.sh`

## Run with Gradle (alternative to Maven)
```bash
gradle clean test
gradle allureReport   # Allure HTML under build/reports/allure-report
```

Reports:
- Cucumber HTML: `target/cucumber-report.html` (Maven)
- Aggregated HTML: `target/cucumber-html-reports/index.html` (Maven)
- Allure HTML: `target/site/allure-maven-plugin/index.html` (Maven) or `build/reports/allure-report/index.html` (Gradle)
